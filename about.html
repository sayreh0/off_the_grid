        <h2>What is Off-Grid Living?</h2>
        <p>Off-grid living means disconnecting from public power and utilities. It's a lifestyle shift towards self-sufficiency, where you aim to reduce dependency on public infrastructure and live sustainably.</p>
        <p>Off-grid living isn't only about location, it's about choices. Anyone can take small steps toward independence, regardless of where they live. Here's how:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grow your own food, even in a small urban apartment.</li>
          <li>Adopt a healthy lifestyle to reduce dependency on medication and hospitals.</li>
          <li>Achieve financial freedom by minimizing debt, saving, and living with less.</li>
          <li>Choose sustainable alternatives, reduce waste, and upcycle materials to create a greener world.</li>
          <li>Utilize renewable resources like solar and wind energy, and practice water catchment.</li>
        </ul>
